            <strong>ABSTRACT:</strong> This research employs a quasi-experimental design utilising quantitative analysis
            to investigate the impact of ESG ratings on employee well-being. The study focuses on a global sample of
            200-250 employees to ensure statistical integrity and broad relevance. Using terms like "ESG factors" and
            "employee wellbeing," the literature review methodically search databases like Scopus and Google Scholar.

            <p><span class="drop-cap">R</span>esearch has established a connection between Corporate Social
                Responsibility (CSR) initiatives and positive employee outcomes, demonstrating that CSR activities
                correlate with enhanced well-being, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment (Glavas & Kelley,
                2014).</p>

            <p>This study investigates the link between Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings—a metric
                evaluating a firm's sustainability—and employee well-being, including psychological and physical health.
                This approach shifts from traditional CSR to ESG metrics, which provide a quantifiable, multidimensional
                assessment of sustainability practices.</p>

            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
            <p><strong>H1:</strong> There is a significant positive relationship between a firm's ESG performance and
                the wellbeing of its employees. This hypothesis posits that higher levels of ESG performance are
                associated with better employee wellbeing outcomes, as measured by the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental
                Well-being Scale (WEMWBS).</p>
            <p><strong>H2:</strong> Firm size moderates the relationship between ESG performance and employee wellbeing,
                with larger firms exhibiting a stronger positive relationship. This hypothesis explores whether the
                impact of ESG is more pronounced in larger firms due to potentially more structured initiatives.</p>

            <h3>Methodology</h3>
            <p><strong>Survey Design:</strong> Participants will complete a survey featuring the Warwick-Edinburgh
                Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) and questions on firm size, industry type, and pay grade. Data will be
                coded and categorized by ESG scores.</p>
            <p><strong>Analytical Techniques:</strong> The analysis includes Regression Analysis to determine direct
                impact, and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to examine pathways and the moderating role of firm size.
            </p>

            <h3>Application to Business</h3>
            <p>The research will orient the literature and empirical findings towards addressing a specific business
                issue: understanding how ESG initiatives impact employee wellbeing and how this relationship is
                influenced by firm size. Recommendations will be tailored to different industry contexts, offering
                actionable strategies for leveraging ESG for competitive advantage.</p>
