            <strong>ABSTRACT:</strong> With the increasing use of social media, addictive use of this new technology
            also grows. Previous studies found that addictive social media use is associated with negative consequences
            such as anxiety, depression and even sleep disorders. One such is Nightmare Disorder. However, a holistic
            theoretical understanding of how nightmare disorder develops and its effects is still lacking. In this study
            we collected 84 different samples which were given the Nightmare Disorder Index test and the Social Media
            Addiction Test. A correlational study was conducted which included the Pearson Coefficient. Results show
            that the influence of Social Media Addiction on Nightmares is very prominent, significant and positively
            correlated.

            <p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>o study the effects of addiction of Social Media amongst adolescents of
                the age group 12 to 19 over Nightmare Disorder, we formulated a hypothesis that adolescents with heavy
                usage of Social Media have more nightmares than adolescents with less usage.</p>

            <h3>Statement of Problem</h3>
            <p>The independent variable was the amount of time (hours) on social media, while the dependant variable was
                the Number of Nightmares in a week. The present study is based on the correlational research design
                model in 2022 at Pune, India. This design fits the research as it aimsed to know the relation (how and
                how much) between Social Media Addiction and Nightmare Disorder.</p>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <p><strong>Descriptive Analysis:</strong> A total sample of 82 participated. The mean of SMA (Social Media
                Addiction) and Nightmare Disorder is 69.52 and 6.14 respectively. Standard deviation of 28.249 and 4.827
                indicate a healthy distribution of the sample.</p>
            <p><strong>Paired Samples t-test:</strong> Results indicate a significant difference between Social Media
                Addiction score (M=69.52; SD=28.25) and Nightmare Disorder score (M=6.14; SD=4.83); [t(83) = 22.283, p <
                    .001]. The 95% confidence interval indicated a difference between the means, leading us to reject
                    the null hypothesis.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>After gathering all the data and doing the analysis, the researcher concludes that the effect of
                        social media addiction in adolescents of city of Pune on Nightmares is a real thing. The
                        researcher felt it was urgent to concentrate on adolescent students because a greater proportion
                        of this cohort suffers from social media addiction and night terrors.</p>
                    <p>The schools or colleges should take the necessary steps to ensure that students, teachers, and
                        parents are aware of the benefits of social media and how to help students manage their
                        addiction. They should also be aware of the challenges that students face when trying to fall
                        asleep and take the appropriate steps to address those challenges.</p>

                    <h3>Limitations</h3>
                    <p>In the present study, the sample was of N=84 students as this was a highly time constrained
                        report, thus more varied and higher number of sample would prove to be better at results. This
                        knowledge of the prevalence of nightmare disorder is crucial to the mental health of adolescents
                        as well as their growth, career, and performance.</p>
